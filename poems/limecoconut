Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime 
His sister had another, she paid it for a lime. 
She put the lime in the coconut, and drank them both up 
She put the lime in the coconut, and drank them both up 
She put the lime in the coconut, 
Called the doctor, woke him up, and said, 
"Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take, 
I say, Doctor, to relieve this belly ache? 
I say, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take, 
I say, Doctor, to relieve this belly ache?" 

"Now let me get this straight; 
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank them both up 
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank them both up 
You put the lime in the coconut, 
called your doctor, woke him up, and said, 
'Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take, 
I say, Doctor, to relieve this belly ache? 
I say, Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take, 
I say, Doctor, to relieve this belly ache?' 

You put the lime in the coconut, and drink them both down, 
You put the lime in the cocount, you're such a silly woman! 
Put the lime in the coconut, and drink them both together, 
Put the lime in the coconut, and call me in the morning."
